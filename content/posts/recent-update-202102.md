### Empty Window

It's a long time since last update and almost forget this place to share my life.

COVID-2019 changed my life a lot although I'm now in mainland China where the pandamic control is *Strong and Quick*. In their words, the CPC's decision is quick and correct, but in my opinion, it's a mirror which shows their endless power and willful.

I passed JLPT N1 test in DEC 2020 after about 3 months' study and training. I start study Japanese on Nov 2018 and I think it's much better now after N2 and N1 test.

### Political compass

[Political compass](https://www.politicalcompass.org/) is a website which can evaluate your political personality. I tried myself and find my own political orientationï¼š

*Left* and *Right* here shows support of the government's economic intervention, *Left* show the support of economic intervention and *Right* is in the opposite.

*Authoritarian* and *Libertarian* is just what it means, shows the support of centralising power.

My index is in left down position which is in social democracy area but in my opinion, the environment I live now is in right up area and this is a major reason why I want to make it change.

A more detailed political compass map is as follow:

### Change

A new word *Involution* is now popular among young clusters in China. People in here is busy in making money, making money and making money.

What I want is only a fair society and simple life but this environment is push me to compete, fight and earn. The social problem caused by bureaucratic group and vested interests are worsening the living environment of ordinary people. 

Hope my immigrant plan can success soon.

That's all.
